#This projct was built with the National Education Policy as the topic. The aim was to give more importance to vocational training. The UI consists of an option for students to register for Vocational courses such as Plumbing, Carpentary, Cooking and many more. Provision for seeing nearby trainers has been implemented with the help of Google Maps API.
